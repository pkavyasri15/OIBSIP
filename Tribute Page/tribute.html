            <h2>A brief summary of  Mahendra Singh Dhoni's journey</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Early life</h3>
                <p>
                    Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family to parents from Uttarakhand.He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand.
                    His parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi.Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname "Dhauni".
                    Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team,but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team.
                    His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.

                <h3>Personal Life</h3>
                <p>
                    His ancestral village is Lwali, which is in Jaiti taluka of Almora district of the Uttarakhand state. The village has population of 20 to 30 families. His father Pan Singh Dhoni left the village in 1970 for employment. 
                    He eventually settled in Ranchi. Dhoni's uncle Dhanpat Singh Dhauni and his cousin Hayat Singh Dhauni still live in Lwali.He married Sakshi Singh Rawat on 4 July 2010.The wedding took place in Dehradun, one day after the couple got engaged.
                    Dhoni and his wife have one daughter, Zeeva Dhoni.Dhoni is an enthusiast of the Indian Army. While spending a day with the parachute regiment in Ranchi, Dhoni said, "Since childhood I wanted to join the Army. 
                    Seeing the soldiers, I thought one day I'll be the same".He holds the post of vice-president marketing in India Cements Ltd. The company is headed by former BCCI president and IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings owner N. Srinivasan.

                <h3>Playing Style</h3>
                <p>
                    Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. Dhoni is an unorthodox batsman. He deviates from conventional coaching manuals and showcases his unique batting technique. 
                    Dhoni displays a proclivity for hitting full-length deliveries towards the Long-on, Long-off, and Midwicket regions, rather than the conventional Cover region. 
                    Furthermore, he demonstrates remarkable skill in playing pull shots and hook shots off short-pitched deliveries, putting pressure on the bowler to adjust their line and length accordingly. 
                    Dhoni holds the bat with a firm grip at the bottom of the handle, striking the ball with force and precision to clear the boundary. Despite this, he still retains the capability to produce awe-inspiring, long sixes.

                    Initially, Dhoni appeared as a lower-order attacking batsman but he gradually changed his playing style to deal with high-pressure scenarios and his growing responsibility as a captain. 
                    He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets.He made use of the helicopter shot technique,taught to him by a fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal.
                    His wicket-keeping skill is widely praised by cricket experts but also criticised for lack of good technique.He has a world record for the highest number of stumpings by any wicket-keeper.
                    As a captain, Dhoni was approachable to players.Former cricketers and opposition players underline that his behaviour on cricket ground was calm and composed. He used to allow his bowlers to set field for themselves.
